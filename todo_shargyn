THESIS:
figures:
--incorporate the new satellite image figures...
--H(fieldnotebook)! read through field notebook and add interesting commentary and note important photos
--H(fieldnotebook)! beautify photos and add photos


writing:
--add foliation data to the structural section to support the proposal that foliation is almost always fault parallel
--add info about fracture sets
--Khairkhan Range -- add the term where appropriate

Papers:
--investigate Delvaux 1997 paper on baikal, cited in the Yin 2010 paper in reference to the left-shear zone 
--investigate At the southern extent of the range, some estimates suggest 30-40km of Cenozoic slip on the Gobi-Tien Shan Fault System (CITE Cunningham 2003?). from Cunningham, D., Owen, L. A., Snee, L. W. & Li, J. 2003a. Structural framework of a major intracontinental orogenic termination zone: the easternmost Tien Shan, China. Journal of the Geological Society, London, 160, 575–590.
--read Slip rate and slip magnitudes of past earthquakes along the Bogd left-lateral strike-slip fault (Mongolia)
--are there slip estimates for faults in the Altai?
Late Pleistocene slip rate of the Höh Serh–Tsagaan Salaa fault system, Mongolian Altai and intracontinental deformation in central Asia
Late Quaternary rates of uplift and shortening at Baatar Hyarhan (Mongolian Altai) with optically stimulated luminescence

Organizing Terminology:
Altai Range == NW-SE striking
Gobi-Altai Range == E-W striking
Intersection Wedge -- the uplifted area in the southwestern corner of the basin. 
LKT and UKT == Lower and Upper Khantaishir Thrusts
Khantaishir range == east side of basin
Khairkhan Range == along shargyn fault on north side of basin
Shargyn Fault == Along north side
Bogd Fault == Along south side
Tonhil Fault == Along west side
Dariv Range == to the north
Dariv Basin
Dariv Thrust 
Sutai Range == to the northwest
Bolnay Fault
MAKE A FIGURE AT BOTH THE BROAD AND LOCAL SCALES AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMINOLOGY IN THE PAPER


April 5th -- thesis draft ready
May 1st -- get edits done from oli and jane connor
May 10th -- Thesis is DUE
May 17th -- presentations

permanently paused (these things should be put in the SUPP doc)
--talk about the fault orientations
--add some info about when slip and deformation started in the Altai and the Gobi-Altai, add to the respective paragraphs in the introduction
--read the cunningham or howard paper that has lots of useful geomorphic indicators, incorporate some of these
--come up with a better color scheme for cross-sections -- maybe find and look at some real publication quality cross-secs and see what they did
talk to Devin about looking at geomorphic features along some of the faults. Especially, where they might indicate different past motions. refer to castelltort 2012
Compile kinematic indicators and foliations and fractures and see if there are any interesting trends
read "Active tectonics and late Tertiary strain distribution in central and eastern Iran." - apparently it addresses how strike-slip faults intersect and interact
--looks like a pretty good template for how to structure my paper
think about erosion and deposition rates and see if that would provide any weak constraints on the age of the basin 
investigate the crazy drainage in the southwest of the basin
calculate exactly how much mass deficit would cause the negative bouguer anomaly
also calculate the error in the gravity measurements -- is the negative bouguer anomaly under the shargyn basin real?
finalize my geologic map
--make a lithologic map
----remake polygons
----find polygon holes
----fill polygon holes
----categories: general intrusives, dariv/khantaishir igneous arc rocks, lake zone greenschist facies metasedimentary and volcanic rocks, dariv/shargyn fault high grade metamorphics, alluvium, Main mongolian lineament, carboniferous metamorphics and intrusives
figure out what the hell the insar images mean for shargyn basin
read about and discuss the connections to other conjugate strike-slip fault systems in Eurasia.(investigate the conjugate V-shaped faults discussed in the conclusion of Yin 2010)
