THESIS:
todo:
--respond to helen after turning in draft to jane and oli
--read through and use jane connor's commentary to improve writing style

presentation:
--add citations to images
--add new images and remove older images
--incorporate my edits on back of arch test
--incorporate jane connor's suggestions from email

permanently paused (these things should be put in the SUPP doc)
--read Slip rate and slip magnitudes of past earthquakes along the Bogd left-lateral strike-slip fault (Mongolia)
--maybe add more photos?
--talk about the fault orientations
--add some info about when slip and deformation started in the Altai and the Gobi-Altai, add to the respective paragraphs in the introduction
--read the cunningham or howard paper that has lots of useful geomorphic indicators, incorporate some of these
--come up with a better color scheme for cross-sections -- maybe find and look at some real publication quality cross-secs and see what they did
talk to Devin about looking at geomorphic features along some of the faults. Especially, where they might indicate different past motions. refer to castelltort 2012
Compile kinematic indicators and foliations and fractures and see if there are any interesting trends
read "Active tectonics and late Tertiary strain distribution in central and eastern Iran." - apparently it addresses how strike-slip faults intersect and interact
--looks like a pretty good template for how to structure my paper
think about erosion and deposition rates and see if that would provide any weak constraints on the age of the basin 
investigate the crazy captured? drainage in the southwest of the basin
calculate exactly how much mass deficit would cause the negative bouguer anomaly
also calculate the error in the gravity measurements -- is the negative bouguer anomaly under the shargyn basin real?
finalize my geologic map
--make a lithologic map
----remake polygons
----find polygon holes
----fill polygon holes
----categories: general intrusives, dariv/khantaishir igneous arc rocks, lake zone greenschist facies metasedimentary and volcanic rocks, dariv/shargyn fault high grade metamorphics, alluvium, Main mongolian lineament, carboniferous metamorphics and intrusives
figure out what the hell the insar images mean for shargyn basin
read about and discuss the connections to other conjugate strike-slip fault systems in Eurasia.(investigate the conjugate V-shaped faults discussed in the conclusion of Yin 2010)
