\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Landsat Imagery basemap showing important locations for this study. The large white box surrounding the Shargyn Basin is the new mapping from this study. The white area surrounding the Dariv Range indicates mapping performed by \citet {Dijkstra2006} and as a part of unpublished research by Claire Bucholz. The area surrounding the Sutai Range was mapped by \citet {Cunningham2003}. The small white boxes around the Shargyn Basin show areas that we studied in the field. The red lines are labeled cross-sections that will be discussed in the Structural Evidence section. A GPS vector near the city of Altai is shown in the northeast. Earthquake focal mechanisms in the area are also shown.}}{13}

The shaded Junggar Block is mechanically rigid. The Junggar Block may be a trapped block of oceanic crust \citep {Carroll1990a}. The Hangay Block consists of microcontinental fragments that accreted during the early stages of the Central Asian Orogeny. It is not shaded because it is probably not mechanically rigid.
