Sutai
primarily a restraining bend related to the
Crustal architecture and active growth of the Sutai Range, 
flower shapes thrust faults
--maybe other nearby equal strike thrusts are bend related flowers

Howard 2006 et. al. Competing Processes of....:
Mesozoic basin formaiton
-- maybe extensional, maybe compressional
-- maybe realted to tien shan or bei shan collision events
Cenozoic basin formation
-- indo-eurasian collision -- tapponnier and molnar 1979
-- central mongolia craton is passive and immobile and requires motion around it. 
complex fault system
--east dariv thrust
--forebergs and thrusts from the tonhil and sutai 
--piggyback basin on top of dariv range thrust (piggyback basins are on top of thrust sheets, foredeeps are in front of thrusts)

tapponnier and molnar 1979
--continuum approach to imagining the tectonics of central asia
--because things slowly transition, they are probably related to decreasing effects of the india/eurasia collision
--this seems totally compatible with the idea that slab rollback/back-arc extension would have an effect

if there is motion related to the east asian subduction zone rather than the india/eurasia collision, it needs to be teased out:
how to find it? are there places that we can find that can't be explained only by the india/eurasia situation, both on the regional scale and local scale. 

is there anyway to actually measure the amount of slab rollback fully accurately
--spent a brief amount of time looking at various estimates
--could paleomag data between japan and some far-field location give a reasonable answer?
----requires finding volcanic rocks of the right age
----or could you construct a time series of distances?
--NO!
--could calculate a broader based gps back-arc deformation rate including intra-plate motion on modern rollback zones and get a percent accomodated by the intraplate motion, then compare that to the modern subduction zones.

paleomagnetic paper regarding rotation
--didn't understand much of the bulk of the paper because i have never dealt with paleomag data before
--two main pieces of data -- no more than 10 degrees rotations, new ages for some volcanics
--no more than 10 degrees rotation implies that restraining bends were not formed by strike slip fault rotation
--this means that the faults formed in place or close to in place and that there has been a partitioning between strike slip and oblique thrust/slip faults. 
--does this mean that it was the same in the past? the maximum stress has likely rotated over the past 70 million years. 

maybe we should categorically look at the age of the strike slip faults versus the age of the thrust faults. Are they significantly younger?

what if the whole southern strike slip system was unidirectional and then india began applying enough stress such that it split near dariv/sutai, both forming the opposite oriented strike slip faults and the sutai range?

I'm able to find quite a bit of information on determining paleostress from old, inactive faults. But, most of the faults in Mongolia are still active.  There doesn't seem to be much about determining paleostress from active faults. I guess we would need to be able to determine other zones where current deformation hasn't overprinted the older stress indicators
