COLOR SCHEME:
recent basin sediments -- yellow
uplifted recent basin sediments -- orange
igneous -- magenta
sedimentary (volcanosedimentary included, but distinguished in individual descriptions, essentially this category is "depositional, but not recent")
metamorphic

color scheme is difficult, think about this some more

map classification scheme:
contacts
--intrusive
--depositional
--faulted
----thrust
----strike-slip
----normal
----unknown
--tectonic (because i'm not separating any metamorphic units, the only tectonic boundaries should be faults)

rock units:
alluvium
sedimentary
metamorphic
--low-grade
--high-grade
igneous

i think i should classify the final map by general age category
--paleo/mesoproterozoic
--neoproterozoic/cambrian
--ordovician/silurian
--devonian/carboniferous/permian
--triassic/jurassic/cretaceous/paleogene
and by who mapped it:
--russian map
--cunningham
--MIT group
--djikstra?

primary:
results of oli meeting:
develop a coherent argument for the transpressional basin
--left lateral bend at the southeast corner results in some component of step over to the khantaishir and shargyn faults
--nw striking thrusts on the southern margin
--the east dipping fault on the west side
--southwest corner is a diffuse uplifted region due to the collision of left-lateral gobi-altai and the right-lateral altai fault systems.
--some slight uplift at the western margin due to transpressional motion on the 

Discussion with Oli
--simple to complex
--color code faults
--expand map to include other published maps nearby (cunningham's sutai map)
--cross-sections in both directions across the basin
--develop an introduction about basins
--finish writing the thesis proposal
--discuss looking the change between right lat and left lat

investigating basin literature:
--read about santa barbara basin
--read about qaidam basin
--read about miocene ridge basin
--chapter 1 of busby has a section on strike-slip basins
--read crowell 1974b from busby chap 1
--read about intracontinental wrench basins and transpressional basins

write about how past motion might be well preserved due to the low rates of erosion, maybe bring up the flap summits thing?
