THESIS:
cross-sections tasks:
--make the cross-section sat image map pairs
--get rid of the useless cross-secs, get rid of the carbroken, bugat, and the east shargyn ones, move them to an appendix
--incorporate modifications to the east shargyn xsec

todo:
--read through and use jane connor's commentary to improve writing style
--ADD A SECTION ON THE MAIN TRANSECT THROUGH THE WEDGE?!
--move the interpretation to after the structural evidence
--read through the whole document and get rid of notes and cleanup
--read through field notebook and add interesting commentary and note important photos
--discuss the possible anticline near the haliun fault? 

currently i have two shargyn basin scale images
--make the topobasemap with faults and locations on it
i should use the topography basemap with a faults on it, but i need to figure out how to do fault in gmt with teeth and strike-slip motion indicated

edits to final figures:
--add fault motion indications to broad
--add fault motion to local figures
--add cross-section labels and

check all figure labels to ensure they point out the interesting features and explain all the important values
relabel modified map figures
"The red lines indicate cross-sections and the adjacent letters provide an index for these cross-sections. The white boundaries separate different mapping the areas. The southern area is the mapping performed during this field season, with the smaller enclosed boxes being the areas which we directly observed. The northwestern mapping area of the Sutai Range was performed by \citet{Cunningham2003}. The northeastern mapping was performed by \citet{Dijkstra2006} and as a part of unpublished research by Claire Bucholz."

presentation:
--add citations to images
--add new images and remove older images
--incorporate my edits on back of arch test
--incorporate jane connor's suggestions from email

Organizing Terminology:
Altai Range == NW-SE striking
Gobi-Altai Range == E-W striking
Intersection Wedge -- the uplifted area in the southwestern corner of the basin. 
LKT and UKT == Lower and Upper Khantaishir Thrusts
Khantaishir range == east side of basin
Khairkhan Range == along shargyn fault on north side of basin
Shargyn Fault == Along north side
Bogd Fault == Along south side
Tonhil Fault == Along west side
Dariv Range == to the north
Dariv Basin
Dariv Thrust 
Sutai Range == to the northwest
Bolnay Fault
MAKE A FIGURE AT BOTH THE BROAD AND LOCAL SCALES AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMINOLOGY IN THE PAPER


April 5th -- thesis draft ready
May 1st -- get edits done from oli and jane connor
May 10th -- Thesis is DUE
May 17th -- presentations

permanently paused (these things should be put in the SUPP doc)
--read Slip rate and slip magnitudes of past earthquakes along the Bogd left-lateral strike-slip fault (Mongolia)
--maybe add more photos?
--talk about the fault orientations
--add some info about when slip and deformation started in the Altai and the Gobi-Altai, add to the respective paragraphs in the introduction
--read the cunningham or howard paper that has lots of useful geomorphic indicators, incorporate some of these
--come up with a better color scheme for cross-sections -- maybe find and look at some real publication quality cross-secs and see what they did
talk to Devin about looking at geomorphic features along some of the faults. Especially, where they might indicate different past motions. refer to castelltort 2012
Compile kinematic indicators and foliations and fractures and see if there are any interesting trends
read "Active tectonics and late Tertiary strain distribution in central and eastern Iran." - apparently it addresses how strike-slip faults intersect and interact
--looks like a pretty good template for how to structure my paper
think about erosion and deposition rates and see if that would provide any weak constraints on the age of the basin 
investigate the crazy drainage in the southwest of the basin
calculate exactly how much mass deficit would cause the negative bouguer anomaly
also calculate the error in the gravity measurements -- is the negative bouguer anomaly under the shargyn basin real?
finalize my geologic map
--make a lithologic map
----remake polygons
----find polygon holes
----fill polygon holes
----categories: general intrusives, dariv/khantaishir igneous arc rocks, lake zone greenschist facies metasedimentary and volcanic rocks, dariv/shargyn fault high grade metamorphics, alluvium, Main mongolian lineament, carboniferous metamorphics and intrusives
figure out what the hell the insar images mean for shargyn basin
read about and discuss the connections to other conjugate strike-slip fault systems in Eurasia.(investigate the conjugate V-shaped faults discussed in the conclusion of Yin 2010)
